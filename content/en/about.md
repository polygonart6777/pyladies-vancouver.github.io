PyLadies Vancouver is a Python programming group for women in the Vancouver area.
We welcome people who have never programmed before, experienced programmers, and everyone in between.

At PyLadies we welcome all women, inclusive of trans women. Further we would like to extend a special invitation to
nonbinary folks, as many (but not all) of the oppressions facing women in our industry are also experienced by nonbinary individuals.
Persons with any gender identity are welcome to attend our meetups, but should respect that PyLadies Vancouver is a place
where women's voices are centered.

If you would like to present at our meetup, please fill in this form:

We expect everyone attending our meetups to abide by our Code of Conduct.
PyLadies is an international mentorship group with a focus on helping more women become active participants and leaders
in the Python open-source community. Our mission is to promote, educate and advance a diverse Python community through outreach,
education, conferences, events and social gatherings.

PyLadies Vancouver reside and share knowledge on the unceded territories of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm, Skwxwú7mesh, Stó:lō and Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh Nations. We encourage participation from members from Indigenous communities across Canada.
